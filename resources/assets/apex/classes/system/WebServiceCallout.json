The request is an instance of a type that is created as part of the auto-generated stub class. A map of key-value pairs that represent the response that the external service sends after receiving the request. In each pair, the key is a response identifier. The value is the response object, which is an instance of a type that is created as part of the auto-generated stub class. An array of strings that contains information about the calloutâ€”web service endpoint, SOAP action, request, and response. The order of the elements in the array matters. Element at index 0 ([0]): One of the following options for identifying the URL of the external web service. Endpoint URL. For example: 'http://YourServer/YourService'   Named credential URL, which contains the scheme callout, the name of the named credential, and optionally, an appended path. For example: 'callout:MyNamedCredential/some/path'      Element at index 1 ([1]): The SOAP action.
